Robert Fischler (acting under the cosmobi alias) created an Android prototype but this technical skill set is not sufficient enough (by himself) to create a more responsive production release nor to produce fully functional prototypes for other platforms (like Web or iOS). The Android prototype was written in Dart using the Flutter platform, so multi-platform export is theoretically within reach.

### The Android app is available on Google Play.
Here is a [Web link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cosmobi.dpora) to the app and below is the QR code link.
